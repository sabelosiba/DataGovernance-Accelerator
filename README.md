## What is Governance
- is manner an entity chooses to oversee the control and direction of an area of interest.
- it takes the form of how decisions are made, regulated and enforced.
  
## What is Data Governance
- Discovery ( what you have )
- Classification - assigning data into categories
- Policy ( What to keep ) - setting guidelines and standards
- Rules - ways to help enforce data policies
- successful data governance also means that data risk can be minimized, data compliance and regulatory requirements can be met with ease.

## Data Governance Vs Data Management
- Data governance is focused on roles and responsibilities, policies, definitions, metrics and lifecycle of data.
- Data management is the technical implementation of data governance.

## DG Vs Information Governance
- DG focuses on data, independent of its meaning.
- IG is concerned with the meaning of the data and its relationship in terms of outcomes and value to the organization, customers and other stakeholders.

## The Value of Data Governance
- main advantages :
  - improved data quality
  - increased data compliance
  - improved data-driven decision-making
  - enhanced business perfomance
  - improved data search
  - reduced risks from data-related issues
  - reduced data management costs
  - established rules for handling data

# Creating a Data Governance Program
- Data governance cycle.

## Developing a Data Governance Framework
### Leadership and Strategy
- Your data governance program must be aligned with the strategy of the organization.
- Data plays a role in many aspects of the organization strategy, including risk management , innovation and operation efficiencies.

### Roles and Responsibilies
- Your data governance will be possible only with right people doing the right things at the right time.
- Each framework includes the identification and assignment of specific roles and responsibilities.

### Policies, Processes and Standards
- This are at the heart of Data governance program and guide responsibilities and support uniformity across organization.
- Each of these must be designed, developed and deployed. depending on size and complexity of the organization.

### Metrics
- Data governance program must have mechanism to measure whether it is delivering the expected results.
- Based on the metrics, you and team can make continuous improvements to ensure program is producing value.

### Tools
- Master Data management
- data catalogs
- search
- security
- integration
- analytics
- Compliance

### Communications and Collaboration
- Ongoing and evolving requirements, high quality communications are key.
- communication such as in-person meetings, emails and workshops.

## Preparing for Data Governance
- forming a team, creating a plan, nuy tools is not enough to implement data governance.
- Data governance requires understanding whether organization is ready to accept it, Being ready to determine which data culture exists.
- Ensure organizations strategy is fully aligned with the proposed program.

## What is data culture?
- refers to shared values, beliefs and practices within an organization that promote data-driven approach to decision-making, innovation and everyday operations.
- data culture is how your organization values data and how it manages and uses it.

### Assessing the Data Culture
- To increase chances of success - understand data culture of your organization and determine how to broaden it and mature it.
- In a data culture, decisions are based on data and the insights they can produce.
- Only make data-drive decisions if the data used is trusted.
- Trust is built when data is high quality, its origin and value are understood and team members know how it can contribute to the goals of the business.
- To start, assess the maturity of your organizations data culture.

## Maturing the Data Culture
- To better prepare the organization for data governance by maturing the data culture.
  - Help leaders communicate the value of data.
  - Provide basic tools and education for data use that include manipulating data, analytics, data cleansing, basic query commands and visualization.
  - Do something to show progress.
  - provide a channel for feedback and positive discussion.
 
  ## Assessing Data Governance Readiness
  - Before begin designing data governance consider determining if organization is ready for data governance program.
  - data governance readiness
    - Tha basic data culture exists
    - Program 100% aligned with business strategy
    - Senior leadership is 100% committed to the program and its goals.
    - Senior Leadership understands this is a strategic, enterprise program
    - The program has the commitment to fund its creation and to maintain it in the long term.
    - You have documented the ROI
    - Legal and compliance teams understand and support the goals of the program
    - Fundemental data skills exist for the data governance journey.
    - The IT organization is capable and resourced to support the program.

## Defining Data
### Why all the focus on data?
- Data refers to collections of digitally stored units.
- Data is also defined based on its captured formT.
  - structured : formatted to a set structure, fits nicely intoa table, ready for analysis.
  - unstructure : stored in native format must be processed to be used.
  - semi-structured : Data that contains additional information to enable the native format to be searched and analyzed.

## The role of Data in the 21st Century
## Data-Driven Decision Making
## Data as the New Oil
- data must be organized and analyzed to understand patterns, make decisions, identify problems and feed other systems.

## Data Ownership
- describes the rights a person or organization has over one or more data sets.

## Data Architecture
- Enterprise Architecture (EA) is when designing the technical needs of an organization to support its business strategy.
- Using standards and established principles, organizations can analyze, design, plan, and implement the right technologies, policies, and projects to support business goals.
- A subset of EA is data architecture.
- Data architecture is the agreed blueprint for how data supports an organization’s functions and technologies.
- Data architecture supports:
  - ensuring data is available to those who need it and approved to use it.
  - Reducing the complexity of accessing and utilizing data
  - Creating and enforcing data protections to support organizational policies and obligations
  - Adopting and agreeing to daa standards
  - Optimizing the flow and eefient use of data to eliminate bottlenecks and duplication.

  ## The Lifecycle of Data
  1. Creation : Manual or automated data get created internally or externally.
  2. Storage : data must be stored, most likely in database, also database needs a home as local drive, server or cloud service.
  3. Usage : Data may need to be processed to useful. including cleaning it of errors, transforming it to another format and securing access rights
  4. Archival : data not currently used moved to long term term storage system out of production environment. in future can be retrieved and utilized.
  5. Destruction : make data inaccessible and unreadable. it can be physical destruction of a device such as a hard drive.

  *The idea that data is in different states at different times is an essential context of data governance. Depending on the stage of its life, data may be treated differently and have unique requirements.*

## Understanding the impact of Big Data
### The role of the U.S. Census in the information revolution
- d

## Defining Big Data
- Big data is structured and unstructured data that is so massive and complex in scale, that it’s difficult and often impossible to process via traditional data management techniques.
- Define and characterize big data :
  - Volume : the scale of data being produced is unorecedented and requires new tools, skills and processes.
  - Variety : new formats emerg all the time, requires different methods of handling from analysis to security
  - Velocity : data is moving at increasing speed.
  - Variability : The fact that the creation and flow of data are unpredictable.
  - Veracity : The quality, accuracy and truthfulness of large volume of different sets of data differ, causing challenges to data management.
 
### Drivers of Big Data
- the world creating more data each data which is more than all the data created since the dawn of civiliation.

### Consequences of Big Data
- Even assuming data is good quality
  - its not easily accessible
  - its not easy to analyze
- 80% of data is unstructured
- a lot of data has duplicates
- some data is bad, has errors, cannot be trusted

### What about small data?
- spreadsheets, short surveys and go-to lists

### Enter the realm of Smart Data
- Smart has emerged as a new term that defines big data thats been optimally prepared for use to deliver highest usiness value.
- Smart data uses new processes and tools to make the data most useful.
- Analytics applications can use high-quality real-time data generated in a manufacturing setting.

## Identifying the roles of data
- its critical to ensure that data is high quality, secure, compliant and accessible to the right peaople at the right time.

## Operations
- Business operations concern with deffirent set of activities to run the day to day needs and drives the mission of an organization.
- Operations use data to make decisions, enable systems to run, and deliver data to internal and external entities.

## Strategy 
- This is creating a plan that supports objectives and goals.
- Understanding the challenges to delivering on the organizations purpose and then agree to solutions.
- Strategy leads to implementation and requires the support of operations to realize its goals.


## Decision Making
- Within organizations, access to large quantity data and information has resulted in quicker and better-quality business decisions.

## Measuring
- Organizations are in a continuous state of measurement, Every observed unit of data contributes to building a picture of the business.
- Data measurements can be quantitative or qualitative.

## Monitoring 
- This is an on going process of collecting and evaluating the performance of item of interest, project or system.
- Monitoring helps to ensure the continuity, stability and reliability of that being supervised.
- The data produced through monitoring feeds reports, reeal-time systems and software-based dashboards.
- monitoring is another process thats converts data into insight
- you have to *measure* something that you want to *monitor* 🤝
-

## Insight management
- begins with gathering and analyzing data from different sources, In order determine wat data process.
- involves designing and creating the most effective manner to communicate findings.

## Reporting
- are online or physical presentations of data and information on some aspect of an organization. e.g sales of a product during specific period
- purpose of reporting is largely about iimporved decision-making.

## Other Roles of Data
- Artificial intelligence (AI) : it is from the data that AI learns patterns and determines probabilities.
- Problem-solving : Data plays a role in how a problem is defined, determine solutions available, evaluate solution to use and measure the success or failure of the solution applied.
- Data reuse : reduces data collection dulication and increase the value of data

## Improving Outcomes with Data

## Approaching Data anas Asswet
- An asset is something owned by a person. organization with expectation to bring economic benefit.
- includes generation of income, reduction of expenses or increase in net worth.
- Asset can be tangible or intangible:
  - tangible ( physical ) : inventory and property.
  - intangible : copyrights
- Data is intangible
- economic value of data :
  - improves operations
  - increases existing revenue
  - reduces risk
  - builds relationships with customers and stakeholders
  - improve quality of products and services.
  - enables innovation

## Data analytics
- Basics steps in data analysis

- four types of data analytics :
  - Descriptive : It is insight on past performance.
  - Diagnostic : answer to “Why did this happen?” by taking a more in-depth look at data to uncover subtle patterns.
  - Predictive : use techniques to find patterns and make predictions about the future.
  - Prescriptive : focuses on what action should be taken from predicted trends

## Data management
- Data management is the implementation of data governance
- *Data governance is defining the roles, policies, controls and processes for increasing the quality and value of organization data*
- you collect and store data, you are technically managing it.
  
**Who would choose to make decisions based on bad data?**
- Poor data management results in security and compliance issues, error in data sets and low confidence in the quality of data.
- On other hand, good data management result in reduced data security breaches and lower compliance, regulatory and private issues.
- Data management processess involve the collection, storage, organization, maintenance and analytics of an organization.
- responsibilities include data standarduzation, encrytion and archiving.

## Governing Data
- means that some level of control exists to support a related policy.eg back-up daily data and control is documentation.
- The success og=f governing data can be reduced to 3 factors:
  - People : people are defining, designing and maintaning data use. And responsible for quality.
  - Policies : a data policy contains set of adopted rules that handle data in specific condintions and for particular outcomes. policies apply in quality, privacy and security.
  - Metrics : consinde how each policy is measured. Metrics must be in support of both technical and business needs.

## Examining the Broader value of Data
- Data democratization - is the ability of team members to access data they need for their work, without relying on specialists.
- A data silo is data repository controlled by an entity in an organization but not known/shared by other parts of the business.
- data silos reduce collaboration and increase data inconsistencies, also they source of risk including security and regulatory issues.
- data governance helps eliminate data unnecessary data siloes.

## Data catalogs
- *how members can find data*
- method of data discoverability is the creation of an enterprrise data catalog.
- e.g store catalog of product details
- 3 benefits of data catalogs:
  - Finding data : helps users identify and locate data that is useful.
  - Understanding data : answers data questions the purpose and data user
  - Making data more useful : creats visibility, describe value and provides access to information.

- data catalog cointains data about the data called metadata
- 3 types of metadata in a data catalog:
  - Technical metadata : Data about the design of a data set. e.g tables,files names
  - Business metadata : organizational data such as business description, assessment of data quality
  - Operational metadata : Data such as when the data was last accessed, who accessed it and when was it last backed up.
 - Metadata examples : filenames, file locations, data owners & stewards, data descriptions, dates created & last modified, list of database tabkes and views.

- with data catalog, an ot=rganization can :
  - reduce data duplication
  - increase operational effeciencies and innovation
  - understand data quality
  - manage compliance

## From Data to Insight
- actionable data is the most valuable data to an organization.

## Data analytics
- Data analysis is identifying data set. examining it and reporting on findings. its a subset of data analytics
- Dta analytics is science that involves collectiong, cleaning, organization, storing and analyzing data
- The source of data for analytics is one or combination of :
  - First-party data : data that an organization collects.
  - Second-party : obtained from another organization
  - Thrird-party : aggregated data obtained from a provider

## Data Monetization
- data valuation - without a process to place a price on a data set.
- data monetization - is when data provides an economic benefit to an organization
- data valuation is a requirement for data monetization such as selling or licensing data.
- ways to determine data valuation:
  - Cost value method : value is calculated by determining how much it costs to produce,store and replace lost data.
  - Market value approach : value is calculated by researching how comparable data is being priced in open market.
  - Economic value approach : calculated by measuring the impact a data set has on the business bottom line.
  - With-and-without method : claculated by quantifying the impact on cash flow if a data set needs to be replaced.
 
## Data-Driven Descision Making
- is process of using data to drive business decisions.
- DDDM needs data culture
- Ensuring the right people can use the right data at the right time requires data security and data use policies
- Six-step process to DDDM:
  1. Define the Objectives : relative with orgganizational goals. help scope the work and define metrics.
  2. Identify the data : in addition to using data catalogue, enterprise search this requires engaging with impacted stakeholders. also consult data stewards, data owners
  3. Prepare the data : use deep data science skills to prepare the data for use
  4. Analyze the data : complex analysis and continuous efforts used, include support for ETL architecture. To analyze this data need visualizations.
  5. Determine the findings : once data is displayed in variety of ways, you can ask questions about it.
  6. Take action : Make your decisions.
 
## Developing a Data Strategy for Improved Results
- *Why does every organization need a data strategy?*
  - The purpose of any type of strategy is to agree on a set of guiding principles that inform decision-making in support of a desired outcome.
  -  In simple terms, it’s the roadmap on how to reach your goals.
- Importance of a Data Strategy: A data strategy provides clarity on how to utilize data as a high-value asset to achieve organizational objectives.
- Purpose of Strategy: A strategy outlines guiding principles for decision-making and resource allocation, ensuring alignment with the organization's vision and mission.
- Risks of Operating Without a Strategy: Without a clear strategy, conflicting goals may arise, leading to inefficiency and chaos.
- Benefits of Having a Strategy: Organizations with a well-defined strategy execute more efficiently, achieve higher profits, and are more successful in reaching their goals.
- Scope of Strategy: A data strategy should encompass all aspects of data management, including usability, accessibility, quality, security, and compliance.
- Tailoring to Organization Size and Complexity: Data strategies should be adapted to the size and complexity of the organization, with variations between small businesses and multinational corporations.
- Actionable Advice: Organizations without a data strategy should create one, while those with existing strategies should ensure they are current and effectively communicated.

Overall, data is a critical asset for businesses and requires deliberate management through a well-defined strategy to realize its full potential for driving organizational success.

## Creating a Data Strategy
- The creation of a data strategy, starting with considerations such as :
  - Data maturity : defined as the degree to which the organization already uses and optimizes data and has experience and skills, quality of the existing data.
  - Industry and size : data prioritization through defense and offense. Defense deals with data security and quality. Offense is using data for insight management and market-facing initiatives.
  - the importance of aligning the strategy with the business goals and ensuring it evolves alongside the changing needs of the organization.
- The five key areas of data requirements :
  - Identify : usable data, clearly defined and described. file name, a file format, and metadata.
  - Store : robust/strong data storage solutions and how it will be shared, accessed, and processed
  - Provision : efficient data sharing processes and reuse data 
  - Process : effective data processing methods e.g data cleansing, standardization, and integration
  - Govern : Institute processes to manage and communicate data policies for data use within the organization. *robust data governance policies.*
 
- The four components of a data strategy :
  - Alignment with the business : the data strategy must support and advance the larger goals of the organization.
  - Identifying roles and responsibilities : outlining the roles of various team members
  - Data architecture : designing data architecture to support scalability and flexibility
  - Data management : implementing comprehensive data management practices to ensure data quality, security, and compliance.
- The significance of data governance in enforcing data rules and maintaining alignment with the data strategy is emphasized, with a reminder that data management and governance processes must be continually updated to remain synchronized with the evolving data strategy.

## Managing and Monitoring your Data Strategy
- The importance of managing and monitoring a data strategy after its implementation. Success hinges on buy-in, a clear roadmap, and effective execution, alongside robust data governance and management functions.
- Recognizing that strategies must evolve, periodic modifications are essential to adapt to changing circumstances and correct errors or gaps.
- Timely strategic corrections demonstrate good leadership.
- Neglecting to review and update the strategy regularly is cautioned against, as it risks relegating the plan to a shelf and missing opportunities for optimization.
- Monitoring involves utilizing appropriate metrics, gathering feedback from stakeholders, and conducting audits to ensure alignment with organizational objectives and agility in response to evolving needs.
